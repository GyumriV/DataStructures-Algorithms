# Sorting

In this assignment, I have created a file 'sorting.java' where I have written three different sorting methods.
These methods are: heapsort, mergesort and quicksort

In my "Main.java" I have created arrays with the same size to be used to determine the time it takes to complete sorting.
When the user runs the program, it will display how long( in milliseconds) it took to finish sorting.

For example: 
When arraySize = 5000, the console will display

"It took 0.16 msecs to heapsort the array"<br>
"It took 0.82 msecs to mergesort the array"<br>
"It took 0.00 msecs to quicksort the array"

The user may also hit the "Enter" key to repeatedly run the tests
