# Assignment 3

Similar to Assignment 2, this program simulates scheduling however this time I have created a minHeap class instead of an AVL tree.

minHeap is more efficient and better suited for priority based operations as they have a simple structure, whereas an AVL tree will maintain a balance requiring more time.
