# Fib
In this assignment, I have created a class "Fib" that asks the user to enter a number n that will generate the fibonnaci value after the sequence is done

# Usage
After running the program, the user will be asked to enter a number in the console. After enter a number and hitting enter another prompt will ask if they would like to perform the fibonacci calculation using recursion or a loop. After the user selects the desired method, the result is displayed in the console.
