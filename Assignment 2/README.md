# Assignment 2

In this assignment I am creating two AVL trees (self balancing binary search tree) that is used to simulate scheduling based on priority.

In my first Main class, I am creating the structure of what my nodes will look like as well as create the methods needed to ensure the trees are self balancing.

My next main class is responsible for scheduling. I created an array with a size of 5000, randomized the order and put them in my first tree. 
After scheduling is complete and my tree is empty it will calcluate and display the time it took to accomplish this. 

Afterward the user will be asked to press 'Enter' to start the next round. If pressed, the trees will switch and repeat the process.
